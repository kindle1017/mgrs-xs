Geo-Coordinates-MGRS-XS version 0.01
====================================

Geo::Coordinates::MGRS::XS - Perl extension for converting MGRS coordinates to
UTM or lat/lon.

This module is written in C/XS for an extra speed boost - if you're not
too worried about execution speed you should probably take a look at the
more mature Geo::Coordinates::UTM, which also handles MGRS coordinates.
